                        A short description of Crunchbase or Crunchbase data which is the origin of the sample_training.companies dataset on MongoDB Atlas.

                        It's difficult to choose a favourite but you can search companies using tags,e.g.
                        "<Link href="/companies/web">Web</Link>{' '}",
                        "<Link href="/companies/edu">edu</Link>{' '}",
                        "<Link href="/companies/game">game</Link>"
                        and so on. Currently, company <strong>{company.name}</strong> (Founded in {company.founded_year}) is one of my favourites and shown here.
